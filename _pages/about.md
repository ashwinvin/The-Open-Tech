##### Welcome to The Tech Source

My name is _Ashwin Vinod_ and I'm a part-time blogger and a student, who
wants to share his knowledge and thoughts about Coding and Open Source projects.

I also maintain a [python library](https://www.github.com/ashwinvin/visionlib) and try to help people in [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10830922/ashwin-vinod).

#### The Story

I started learning python **_two years ago_** as my cousin introduced me to
programming as a way to engage me in something rather waste time. My first language was
C++. Then some bash and finally python.

As I progressed, I found many but blogs all of them were cool but not something I wanted to read.
I decided that it have should more quality content should be available and should be **FREE!**.
And from that moment, I started writing this blog - a blog meant to share quality
news and new Open Source projects meant for people like us.
