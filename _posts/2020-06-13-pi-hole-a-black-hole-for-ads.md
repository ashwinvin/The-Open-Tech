## What is Pi-hole

The Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without
installing any client-side software. If explained with simpler terms, it essentially means an
ad blocker, But conventional  **Ad blockers run on our browsers, while Pi-hole runs
in an another device**  (in our case raspberry-pi). It works by  **blocking Ads before even reaching
your computer**:smile:.
