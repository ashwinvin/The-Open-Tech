Linux Mint 20 Beta has been released. Lets look what happened.

## Introduction

![Linux Mint Desktop](../assets/images/linux_mint.jpg)

Linux Mint 20 code named **‘Ulyana’**. Traditionally Linux Mint codenames take a female name and are alphabetical in sequence. Since all of the Linux Mint 19 codenames were based on the letter ‘T’, it also means the next set of releases will be using codenames based on the letter ‘U’.

Linux Mint 20 will be a **LTS release** and it will be supported till **2025**.
There will only be 64-bit version. They dropped the support for 32-bit. Those who are still 
using 32-bit can continue on Linux Mint 19.x version as they will be supported till 2023.

## Key Changes

Linux Mint 20 is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, the latest long-term support releases of Ubuntu
and will use the Linux 5.4 kernel. As usual, Linux Mint will be providing three desktop
varients to choose from:

- Cinnamon
- Xfce
- MATE

### Cinnamon gets an update

As the Cinnamon desktop environment is the heart of Linux Mint, it gained significant
enhancements and features.

The most exciting of these is the support for **fractional scaling support** in Cinnamon.
Its designed for **High-Resolution** displays and provides new scaling values between 100%
and 200%.

As if that wasn't enough they let you apply different Scaling values to different Monitors
and also comes with the ability **change monitor refresh rate** through an easily-accessible display setting (Ubuntu 20.04 offers this too).

### Warpinator

A new **file transfer tool** has been added with the name **_Warpinator_**.

Warpinator is a reimplementation of **Giver**, a tool which can share files without any
server or configuration. Computers would automatically **see** each other and you could
drag and drop to share files. It was removed from Linux Mint as Giver was discontiued.

With Warpinator you could get rid of Server configurations(FTP, Samba) and the use of external
media(USBs, External HDDs). Warpinator brings back easy file sharing using local network in
Linux Mint.

### NIVIDIA Optimus is improved

Linux Mint 20 improves the support of NIVIDIA Optimus.

The Nividia applet now shows your GPU Renderer and now we can select which card to switch from
its menu.

You read it correct, Snapd is **no longer available** in Linux Mint and APT Packages
are also not allowed to install it.

Although snapd is blocked, you can still install it manually
